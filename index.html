											<h2>Research</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Dr. Niu's research area of interests include Machine Learning, Transfer Learning (Deep Transfer Learning), and Biomedical Informatics. More specifically, he is interested in exploring distant-domain transfer, cross-modality-transfer, graph neural works, and biomedical application with ML. Deep learning is great but it is facing significant difficulties, including but not limited to, insufficient data, incompatible computational power, and dynamic input structure. Below is a short list of open challenges:<br /><br />

1. Transfer Learning <br />
2. Biomedical Data Mining via Knowledge Graphs <br />
3. Recommendation Systems <br />											
4. Human-Object Interaction Detection </a> </p>
